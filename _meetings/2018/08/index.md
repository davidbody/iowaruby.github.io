### Topic

#### Back to Basics: Validation in Rails

Let's talk about how validation works in Rails. This will be a
heavily example-based talk about the basic and not-so-basic aspects
of model validation in Rails. Some topics we'll touch on:

* Basic Rails validations
* Custom validators
* `ActiveModel::Errors` API
* Real world examples

The goal is to go through some best practices and how to use them and some
worst practices and how to avoid them.
